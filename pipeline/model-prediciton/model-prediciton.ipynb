    "# Model Predicitons\n",
    "The prediction process begins by setting up the environment to allow for the retrieval of data, and loading of relevant functions and models. This is followed by extracting the necessary data for inference from the SQLite database, which is done using an SQL query located in an external SQL file. The LabelEncoder and trained pipeline, stored from the modeling process, are then loaded back into the environment to enable prediction. Using these loaded models and the prepared inference data, we generate predictions and associated probabilities for each game. The predictions are converted back to their original form from the encoded labels, and results are composed into a DataFrame. This DataFrame not only includes the predicted outcome for the home team but also the probabilities of the home team winning or losing, linked to each `game_id`. This systematic and modular approach allows for clear, reproducible predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up environment\n",
    "This section of the code sets up the environment necessary for executing the prediction notebook. It begins by importing the required system and path-handling libraries, namely `sys` and `pathlib`. The `functions` directory is appended to the system path, which facilitates the importing of the `prediction_functions` module. This module contains key functions essential for the prediction process. The root directory of the project is located, followed by constructing the relative path to the SQLite database which stores our footy tipping data. This setup ensures all necessary tools and data are accessible and ready for the ensuing prediction operations."

    "The `get_inference_data` function is used to retrieve the data for model inference from an SQLite database. The function takes two arguments: `db_path`, which is the path to the SQLite database, and `sql_file`, which specifies the path to the SQL file that contains the desired query. The function initiates a connection to the SQLite database and reads the SQL query from the provided SQL file. This query is executed on the database to yield the inference data, which is stored in a DataFrame. Once the necessary data has been retrieved, the function closes the database connection, ensuring resource-efficient operation. The function ultimately returns the DataFrame containing the required inference data, facilitating downstream prediction tasks."
