    "# Send my predictions to the boys\n",
    "This system functions as a seamless pipeline that performs a series of intriguing operations, the primary of which is sourcing the current week's Footy Tipper predictions. With this information in hand, the pipeline proceeds to the next stage where it employs the advanced linguistic abilities of ChatGPT. Mimicking the persona of Reg Regan, the AI drafts an engaging and informed email containing the predictions. Upon completion, the email is dispatched to the boys, ensuring they are consistently kept in the loop with the latest Footy Tipper forecasts. The entire operation is a seamless fusion of sports analytics and artificial intelligence, creating an engaging and personalized user experience.\n",

      "Reg Reagan here. I've just had Pat machines crank away their best predictions for this adrenaline-pumping NRL Finals Week 1, 2023 and I thought I'd share the wisdom. If this isn't a public service, I don't know what is.\n",
      "\n",
      "First up, Brisbane Broncos vs Melbourne Storm. The Broncos sitting nice and tidy at the number 2 spot are predicted to triumph. Sitting at a price of 1.61, it might be time to throw some coins at them. Melbourne's at 3rd spot had a fair season, but this ain't fairy tales, kiddos – it’s footy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Penrith Panthers have really been flexing those muscles sitting at the 1st position are predicted to tear apart the New Zealand Warriors, who are staggering at the 4th position. With the bookies offering a sweet 1.11 on the Panthers, don't hold your purses too tight! Warriors at 6.7 might look tempting, but remember, temptation ain't always healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next on the platter, we have Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks vs Sydney Roosters. The Sharks, like the victims of their namesake, are anticipated to bite the dust against the Roosters. A pretty close call with the Sharks at a price of 1.97 and Roosters at 1.87, don't let your loyalties get in the way of your judgement.\n",
      "\n",
      "And lastly - and my personal favourite - Newcastle Knights (the only team worth barracking for) up against the Canberra Raiders. Predictions are that Knights, sitting comfy at the 5th spot will lance those Raiders right from the 8th position to the outback whence they came. A Knight’s victory is valued at a 1.19 price, bet on us or bugger off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for those good punters out there, get your betting slips and biros ready, it’s time for those golden tips: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1lT1SQH-kQPdnOf3ftomobuiv51jEj6t-\n",
