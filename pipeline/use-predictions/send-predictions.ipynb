    "# Send my predictions to the boys\n",
    "This system functions as a seamless pipeline that performs a series of intriguing operations, the primary of which is sourcing the current week's Footy Tipper predictions. With this information in hand, the pipeline proceeds to the next stage where it employs the advanced linguistic abilities of ChatGPT. Mimicking the persona of Reg Regan, the AI drafts an engaging and informed email containing the predictions. Upon completion, the email is dispatched to the boys, ensuring they are consistently kept in the loop with the latest Footy Tipper forecasts. The entire operation is a seamless fusion of sports analytics and artificial intelligence, creating an engaging and personalized user experience.\n",

    "For acquiring prediction data, the script begins by establishing a connection with the SQLite database using the established db_path. Once the connection is created, an SQL query is read from an external file named 'prediction_table.sql'. This query is designed to retrieve the necessary prediction data. The script then executes this query against the SQLite database and fetches the results into a Pandas DataFrame, predictions, enabling further data manipulation and analysis. Following the successful extraction of prediction data, the script closes the connection to the SQLite database to maintain good programming practice. The predictions dataframe is then displayed to review the retrieved data."

    "The final phase, 'Send Emails', sees the footy predictions being disseminated to the intended recipients. The send_emails() function from the 'sending_functions' module is invoked to accomplish this. It accepts several parameters: \"footy-tipper-email-list\", which is the list of recipients who will receive the email; a formatted string that serves as the email subject, dynamically including the round name from the predictions DataFrame; the reg_regan variable, which contains the email content; and the sender's email and password, fetched securely from the environment variables via os.getenv('MY_EMAIL') and os.getenv('EMAIL_PASSWORD') respectively. Finally, it takes the json_path, which might be required for email client authentication. This operation results in all the boys on the email list promptly receiving an email filled with the week's Footy Tipper predictions and tipper picks, all expressed in the unmistakable tone of Reg Regan."
