    "# Send my predictions to the boys\n",
    "This system functions as a seamless pipeline that performs a series of intriguing operations, the primary of which is sourcing the current week's Footy Tipper predictions. With this information in hand, the pipeline proceeds to the next stage where it employs the advanced linguistic abilities of ChatGPT. Mimicking the persona of Reg Regan, the AI drafts an engaging and informed email containing the predictions. Upon completion, the email is dispatched to the boys, ensuring they are consistently kept in the loop with the latest Footy Tipper forecasts. The entire operation is a seamless fusion of sports analytics and artificial intelligence, creating an engaging and personalized user experience.\n",

    "The setup environment section of this project involves importing crucial libraries such as os, sys, sqlite3, pathlib, and pandas for various functionalities, along with dotenv for loading environment variables. Custom functions from the 'use-predictions' directory are also imported. Paths are established to the SQLite database, the secrets environment file, and a service account token file. Lastly, the script loads environment variables from the secrets file, enhancing security for sensitive elements."

    "For acquiring prediction data, the script begins by establishing a connection with the SQLite database using the established db_path. Once the connection is created, an SQL query is read from an external file named 'prediction_table.sql'. This query is designed to retrieve the necessary prediction data. The script then executes this query against the SQLite database and fetches the results into a Pandas DataFrame, predictions, enabling further data manipulation and analysis. Following the successful extraction of prediction data, the script closes the connection to the SQLite database to maintain good programming practice. The predictions dataframe is then displayed to review the retrieved data."

The function compiles this information into an engaging, intelligently crafted email, channeling the persona of Reg Regan. Once the email is generated, it's assigned to the reg_regan variable and printed out for review before being sent to the boys."

      "\n",
      "Starting off, we've got the Penrith Panthers, perched on the top spot, all set to rip apart the Parramatta Eels at a whopping 1.11 head to head price. I reckon the Eels must have lost their way up Parramatta River - they're stuck in 11th place with a poor 7.0 price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down at Kiwi land, the New Zealand Warriors (1.13) look set to send the St. George Illawarra Dragons (16th spot, 6.05) home tail between legs. The Dragons clearly forgot that they're meant to breathe fire, not choke on smokescreens. \n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Dolphins get yet another reality check as the North Queensland Cowboys (1.27) look to wrangle a win out of them. Sitting at 14th spot, maybe the Dolphins would do better swimming than playing footy, eh?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Melbourne Storm (1.13) are brewing up a storm against the Gold Coast Titans (6.05) who seem to be lost in space at the 13th spot. Maybe their GPS failed or something?\n",

      "Sydney Roosters crowing at a 1.17 price against the Wests Tigers stuck at the bottom of the barrel in 17th place, they really should consider switching to a jungle environment. \n",
      "\n",
      "In another universe, the Canberra Raiders (2.94) are set to face a loss against the Brisbane Broncos (1.41) who are prancing around in second place. Maybe the Raiders should focus on raiding some talent next season? \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there's the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs (2.86) who seem to be stuck fetching their own tails against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles (12th spot, 1.43) - and we all know my fondness for Manly. Reminds me of a bunch of spoilt rich kids lost at a picnic. \n",
      "\n",
      "And saving the best for last - our Newcastle Knights (1.68) are ready to joust the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks (5th spot, 2.19) right out of the water. Ah, nothing like the smell of a good Knights victory!\n",

Finally, it takes the json_path, which might be required for email client authentication. This operation results in all the boys on the email list promptly receiving an email filled with the week's Footy Tipper predictions and tipper picks, all expressed in the unmistakable tone of Reg Regan."
