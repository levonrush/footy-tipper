As always, here's the link to the tip folder for your reference: [NRL Round 17 Tips](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lT1SQH-kQPdnOf3ftomobuiv51jEj6t-?usp=sharing).\n",

      "1. St. George Illawarra Dragons vs New Zealand Warriors: The Footy Tipper foresees a loss for the Dragons. When you have mischievous Warriors on the field, dragons tend to get roasted. Keep the fire extinguisher nearby. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Dolphins vs Parramatta Eels: The Dolphins are predicted to lose in this match. Looks like the Eels are in no mood to play nice-nice with the newbies. Swimming lessons might be needed after this game.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Penrith Panthers vs Newcastle Knights: The mighty Penrith Panthers are expected to triumph. Even knights in shining armor bow down to their feline adversaries. Who needs a sword when you have claws?\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Melbourne Storm vs Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles: The Footy Tipper envisions another victory for the Storm. The Sea Eagles might want to rethink their game plan because Stormy weather is headed their way. Better bring an umbrella.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Brisbane Broncos vs Gold Coast Titans: It's time for the Broncos to shine as they are predicted to secure a win. The Titans better be prepared for the beastly Broncos to put on a show. Buckle up, boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. South Sydney Rabbitohs vs North Queensland Cowboys: The Rabbitohs hop into this game with a predicted win. Cowboys may be tough, but rabbits are quick on their feet. The race is on!\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Sydney Roosters vs Canberra Raiders: The Roosters are anticipated to celebrate a victory. It's time for the Roosters to gather and protect their turf from the Raiders. Who will rule the roost?\n",
      "\n",
      "And there you have it, the predictions for NRL Round 17 according to our trusty Footy Tipper. Remember, these predictions are just for fun and banter among mates.\n",

      "Now, onto the important matter of bringing back the biff. Let's light up the passion and intensity of the game by encouraging a bit of biff like the good ol' days. It's time to add a dash of spice to the NRL battles and remind everyone of the fierce rivalry we all love.\n",
