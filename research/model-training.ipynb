    "# Model Training\n",
    "Welcome to the 'Model Training and Prediction' notebook, a crucial facet of our project's data science pipeline. In this notebook, we offer a meticulous examination of our rigorous model development process. The pipeline starts by accepting training data, followed by fitting three distinct types of models to it: Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and XGBoost. The initial stages include encoding categorical variables and executing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection. This is succeeded by the application of genetic algorithms to hyperparameter tuning, operating in tandem with a cross-validation routine. Subsequently, the best model is selected based on the highest F1 score, indicating the balance between precision and recall. Finally, the selected model is utilized to predict the outcomes for the current week's round of NRL matches. This process is iterative and cyclical, with the potential for revisiting earlier stages based on the model's performance. Let us proceed with this in-depth exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up Environment\n",
    "This code segment is setting up the environment for the model training pipeline. It begins by importing sys and pathlib - Python libraries used for managing system parameters and file paths, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then updates the system path to include the \"functions\" directory. This allows for the import of custom modules `modelling_functions`, `model_properties`, and `training_config` which are stored in this directory. These modules contain custom functions and configuration settings that are critical for the later stages of data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, the `project_root` variable is defined. This is achieved by using the pathlib library to establish the root directory of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `db_path` variable is constructed. This is the relative path to the SQLite database \"footy-tipper-db.sqlite\", which is located in the \"data\" directory of the project root. This path will be used for database connectivity throughout the pipeline."

We then connect to this SQLite database and use a SQL query housed in the 'footy_tipping_data.sql' file, found in the 'sql' directory, to extract the required data. This data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, footy_tipping_data, serving as the basis for our subsequent modeling activities. Upon successful extraction of the data, we ensure the database connection is closed, maintaining good coding practice and resource management."

    "During the modeling phase, the `train_and_select_best_model` function, part of our `modelling_functions` module, is invoked. This function initiates the training of Poisson models specifically designed for predicting the scores of the home and away teams. It takes as input the footy tipping data, predictor variables, the outcome variable, and several configuration settings like whether to use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), the number of cross-validation folds, and the optimization metric, all sourced from the `training_config` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function first identifies categorical columns in the feature set for one-hot encoding, creating dummy variables for categorical features. Depending on the choice of using RFE, a feature elimination step may be included in the pipeline. Each model subsequently undergoes hyperparameter tuning using a genetic algorithm, facilitated by the `GASearchCV` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the models are then trained and evaluated through cross-validation. The best models for predicting home and away scores are selected based on superior performance on the chosen optimization metric. The selected models, encapsulated in pipelines with pre-processing steps and hyperparameter tuning, are now ready for the prediction phase.\n",
