    "# Model Training\n",
    "Welcome to the 'Model Training and Prediction' notebook, a crucial facet of our project's data science pipeline. In this notebook, we offer a meticulous examination of our rigorous model development process. The pipeline starts by accepting training data, followed by fitting three distinct types of models to it: Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and XGBoost. The initial stages include encoding categorical variables and executing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection. This is succeeded by the application of genetic algorithms to hyperparameter tuning, operating in tandem with a cross-validation routine. Subsequently, the best model is selected based on the highest F1 score, indicating the balance between precision and recall. Finally, the selected model is utilized to predict the outcomes for the current week's round of NRL matches. This process is iterative and cyclical, with the potential for revisiting earlier stages based on the model's performance. Let us proceed with this in-depth exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up Environment\n",
    "This code segment is setting up the environment for the model training pipeline. It begins by importing sys and pathlib - Python libraries used for managing system parameters and file paths, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then updates the system path to include the \"functions\" directory. This allows for the import of custom modules `modelling_functions`, `model_properties`, and `training_config` which are stored in this directory. These modules contain custom functions and configuration settings that are critical for the later stages of data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, the `project_root` variable is defined. This is achieved by using the pathlib library to establish the root directory of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `db_path` variable is constructed. This is the relative path to the SQLite database \"footy-tipper-db.sqlite\", which is located in the \"data\" directory of the project root. This path will be used for database connectivity throughout the pipeline."

    "During the modelling phase, the `train_and_select_best_model` function, part of our `modelling_functions` module, is invoked. This function initiates the training of three distinct models: XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. It takes as input the footy tipping data, predictor variables, the outcome variable, and several configuration settings like whether to use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), the number of cross-validation folds, and the optimization metric, all sourced from the `training_config` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function first identifies categorical columns in the feature set for one-hot encoding, creating dummy variables for categorical features. Depending on the choice of using RFE, a feature elimination step may be included in the pipeline. Each model subsequently undergoes hyperparameter tuning using a genetic algorithm, facilitated by the `GASearchCV` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the models are then trained and evaluated through cross-validation. The best model, or `footy_tipper`, is selected based on the superior performance on the chosen optimization metric. Additionally, a `LabelEncoder`(`label_encoder`), used to encode the categorical target variable, is returned. This LabelEncoder is specific to the model that performed best. The selected model, encapsulated in a pipeline with pre-processing steps and hyperparameter tuning, is now ready for the prediction phase."

      "Subject: Round 5 NRL Predictions & The Best Bets - Biff Included 🏉 💰\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey Mates, \n",
      "\n",
      "Reg Reagan here, shooting through your absolute must-read synopsis for Round 5 of the NRL. Get ready to throw some banter around and make sure you’re currently sitting, because I’ve got some gold for you lot. \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, let's cut to the chase with the Footy Tipper predictions – your new bible for the betting season. \n",
      "\n",
      "🔮 **Match Highlights:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Melbourne Storm** vs. Brisbane Broncos: Storm’s gonna cook up a storm, sitting pretty at 5th, facing off 12th placed Broncos. Bookies have them at a steal for 1.45. That’s practically robbery without wearing a mask.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bulldogs are about to play dead again, hosting the **Roosters**. At 14th, we could probably see more action in a retirement village. Roosters at 1.25, because let's face it, it's almost a guaranteed win.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Knights vs. Dragons**: As a Knights tragic, I’m calling it – a win for the boys! Don’t let that 15th position fool you; we’re climbing faster than a koala in a gum tree. Knights for the win at 1.47. Dragons? More like dragon their feet. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Rabbitohs and Warriors: Rabbitohs sit at the bottom but are looking to hop their way up. Sadly, the Warriors at 1.73 seem the better bet. Sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Manly vs. **Panthers**: Do I even need to say it? I’d rather support a team on a ten-game losing streak than cheer for Manly. Panthers at 1.62 is like taking candy from a baby – too easy!\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dolphins** are topping the charts and are set to trample the Wests Tigers. 1.54? I’d say that’s money for jam.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Cowboys vs. Titans**: With Cowboys at 3rd, it looks like the Titans are set for yet another beating. Betting on the Cowboys at 1.14 is like investing in beer - always a good idea.\n",
      "\n",
