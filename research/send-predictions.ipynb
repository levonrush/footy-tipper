    "# Send my predictions to the boys\n",
    "This system functions as a seamless pipeline that performs a series of intriguing operations, the primary of which is sourcing the current week's Footy Tipper predictions. With this information in hand, the pipeline proceeds to the next stage where it employs the advanced linguistic abilities of ChatGPT. Mimicking the persona of Reg Regan, the AI drafts an engaging and informed email containing the predictions. Upon completion, the email is dispatched to the boys, ensuring they are consistently kept in the loop with the latest Footy Tipper forecasts. The entire operation is a seamless fusion of sports analytics and artificial intelligence, creating an engaging and personalized user experience.\n",

Custom functions from the 'use-predictions' directory are also imported. Paths are established to the SQLite database, the secrets environment file, and a service account token file. Lastly, the script loads environment variables from the secrets file, enhancing security for sensitive elements."
